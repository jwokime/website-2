<p>I decided to make my boyfriend a cassette mixtape for Christams fitted with songs and speech snippets to inspire the revolutionary spirit.</p>
<p>Cassettes, as it turns out, are quite outdated but not so obsolete that it's been pedastalized like vinyls and typewriters are. That is to say, $40 bucks will get you a decent set on Ebay.</p>
<p>I fought back against the feeling of absurdity as I sat there recording from Spotify, then designed these covers to finish off the gift. It was my first time really designing anything, so I had to get a little experimental to get the look just right. I ended up going with the top one (the one with the hammer and sickle inside a globe).</p>
<p>Side A:</p>
<ul>
<li>A recording of Fidel Castro on the flight over to New York City. The interviewer asks if the rumors are true that he always wears a bulletproof vest. Fidel confidently unbuttons his shirt to reveal his bare chest to the camera. &quot;I have a moral vest. It is strong.&quot; He said.</li>
<li>&quot;Y en eso llego Fidel&quot; by Pablo Neruda, Carlos Puebla</li>
<li>&quot;9 to 5&quot; by Dolly Parton</li>
<li>&quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; by The Rolling Stones</li>
<li>&quot;Hotel California&quot; by Gypsy Kings</li>
<li>&quot;L'internazionale&quot; by Bandiera Rossa</li>
<li>&quot;Words Of Wisdom&quot; by 2Pac</li>
</ul>
<p>Side B:</p>
<ul>
<li>A recording of a speech given by President Lula da Silva of Brazil before he turned himself in. &quot;The powers that be might kill one, two or three roses, but they will never be able to stop the spring from coming.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Chinggis Khaan&quot; by Mongolian throat singing group, Khusugtun</li>
<li>&quot;Chollima on the Wing&quot; by North Korean Archives</li>
<li>&quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot; by Gil Scott-Heron</li>
<li>&quot;Fight the Power&quot; by Public Enemy</li>
<li>&quot;Hasta Siempre&quot; by Carlos Puebla</li>
<li>&quot;Bella Ciao&quot; by The Red Army Choir</li>
<li>&quot;5 Million Ways to Kill a CEO&quot; by The Coup</li>
<li>&quot;Imagine&quot; by John Lennon</li>
</ul>
